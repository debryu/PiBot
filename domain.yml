  utter_chitchat/help:
  - text: No worries I am here to help you! You can say "RESTART" to start over if you are stuck. You can say "ORDER A PIZZA" to start an order. If you want to order many different pizza, do it one at a time (but you can order multiple of the same kind in one step). You can also say "MENU" to see the menu. Or say "ORGANIZE A PARTY" to start a party setup to reserve a room in our restaurant.
