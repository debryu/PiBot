# PiBot
I have created a Pizza Bot for Alexa devices that can run from terminal or using a voice assistant.
PiBot is can be configured to receive pizza orders or party reservations, but can also reply to various questions!

## Installation

```shell
conda create -n rasa python=3.8
conda activate rasa
pip install rasa
```

## Usage

```shell
conda activate rasa
rasa shell
```
